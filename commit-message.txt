feat(web)!: migrate apps/web to Bun runtime + package manager

- Replace `better-sqlite3` with `bun:sqlite` (and adjust `.get()` null semantics)
- Use Bun to run Next.js + Vitest (and fix `fetch.preconnect` typing in tests)
- Run bb.js server verification in a Node worker (Bun bb.js WASM instability)
- Upgrade Node toolchain + Docker images to Node 24
- Replace pnpm lockfile with `bun.lock` and use `bun install` in Docker
- Update docs/tooling references to Bun commands

BREAKING CHANGE: `apps/web` now requires Bun (runtime + install) instead of pnpm/Node-only workflows.
